# Input/Output

A simple mobile-friendly webapp for keeping a daily journal, and tracking of things you want to put
into your head: books to read, games to play, movies to watch, etc.

## Building

Building involves the usual rigamarole:

```
yarn
yarn build
```

Deploying is simple (if you're me, since I own the Firebase app):

```
firebase deploy
```

## Using

If you just want to use the app, you can use the instance I operate at:
