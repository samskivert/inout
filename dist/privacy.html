    <h2>Input/Output Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>
      Input/Output is provided as a public service and is not a commercial product.
    </p>

    <p>
      The app does not collect any personal information from the authentication providers it
      uses to authenticate you when you login. We are provided with a unique identifier (which looks
      something like <small>BzWK4x9dqFgL2r5hbDfTkKnARGm2</small>) and we use that as a key into our
      database to store your information. No other personal information is collected, not your
      name, not your email address, not your computer's IP address. Nothing.
    </p>

    <p>
      The app is built using Google's Firebase platform, which means that we rely on Google not
      to surreptitiously collect data behind the scenes. However, they attest that the Firebase
      platform is compliant with GDPR and introduces no additional reporting requirements other
      than those needed by the apps built on its platform. So this is a good indication that
      they are not storing any data that we are not explicitly asking them to store, and we are
      not explicitly asking them to store anything that is not completely essential to the
      operation of the app: your unique identifier and the data you add to the app itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      The app currently does not use any analytics platform to compute aggregated information
      about its usage. I have no plans to activate analytics for the app, but if I do so, it will
      be noted in this privacy policy. As this is not a commercial product, there is no particular
      need to know even aggregate information about its users.
    </p>

    <p>
      The app does use cookies for the sole purpose of avoiding the need to log in every single
      time you access the app. A unique "session" identifier is generated and stored on your web
      browser to facilitate this process. The session identifier can be linked to your account
      identifier (as described above) and that's it. The session identifier is necessarily secret
      and is not stored anywhere except your computer and (temporarily) on the servers. Neither it
      nor your account identifier are shared with anyone.
    </p>

    <p>
      None of the data you add to the app is shared with any third party. It is only ever stored
      on devices you use to access the app and on the cloud servers that host the app. It is not
      used for advertising or "mined" for other information in any way.
    </p>

    <p>
      The app relies on the security of the Firebase platform, and the authentication provider you
      choose, to secure your data. Firebase uses modern best practices for authentication security
      and backend server security, so we have no reason to believe that the data you store in the
      Input/Output app is any less secure than all the other major websites you probably use.
